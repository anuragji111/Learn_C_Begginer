What will be the output of this code, if the user enters 5 and 9?

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

  int a, b;
  scanf("%d%d", &a, &b);
  int c = a + 2;
  int d = c + b;
  printf("%d", d);

  return 0;
}

SOL.:-

Correct Answer:

16
Explanation:
If the user enters 5 and 9, then based on the scanf() operation, a = 5 and b = 9.

Next operations is c = a + 2 = 7

Next operation is d = c + b = 7 + 9 = 16

Eventually we output 16!
