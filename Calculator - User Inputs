Write a program which does the following

Create a calculator
Declare 2 integer variables 
a and 
b
Initialise the variables 
a and 
b based on two user inputs
Declare an integer variable 
sum - and store the value of addition of 
a and 

b
Declare an integer variable 
diff - and store the value of subtraction of 
a and 
b
Output 

sum and 

diff to the console on separate lines
Sample 1:
Input
Output
35
23
Sum is: 58
Difference is: 12

Sol.:- 
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

  int a, b;
  int sum;
  int diff;
  scanf("%d", &a);
  scanf("%d", &b);
  sum = a + b;
  diff = a - b;
  printf("Sum is: %d\n", sum);//dont forget to print diff on a separate line
  printf("Difference is: %d", diff);
 
  return 0;
}
