To get the size of an array, you can use the sizeof() operator:
For e.g.

          int myNumbers[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
          printf("%d", sizeof(myNumbers));
          Result = 20
Note

The result show 20 instead of 5, when the array contains 5 elements.
It is because the sizeof() operator returns the size of a type in bytes
int type is usually 4 bytes, so from the example above, 4 x 5 (4 bytes x 5 elements) = 20 bytes.
Task
Write a program which does the following

Create an int array containing the elements - 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60
Compile and output to the console the accurate count of the number of integer elements in the given array.

SOL.:-
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

  int Num[6] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60};
  printf("%d", sizeof(Num) / 4);

  return 0;
}
